                        <p>Shila Devi Mandir is one of the famous Hindu temples in Jaipur. The temple has two legends
                             out of which one states when Raja Man Singh I of Amber got defeated by King Kedar, he turned 
                             towards Mata Kaali for her blessings. His prayers were answered when the goddess appeared 
                             in his dreams and stated that a statue of hers was lying beneath the sea near Jessore (Now Bangladesh).
                              She asked him to bring that statue and build a temple. A slab (Shila) was recovered from the sea. 
                              After bringing it back, it was thoroughly cleaned and an idol appeared. Thus the name Shila Devi
                               was given to the temple.</p>
