                        <h2>History of Amer Fort</h2>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>
                            The Meenas founded the small town of Amer in 967 CE. The settlement was built by Raja Alan Singh of the Chanda clan. The famous Amer fort was later built on the ruins of this settlement by Raja Man Singh, the Kachwaha King of Amer.
                            <br />
                            The city of Amer has become even more popular as the home town of princess Jodha- the Consort of Akbar. Raja Man Singh was an ally in the court of Akbar. Due to this, many structures in the fort are influenced by Mughal style architecture.
                            <br />
                            The reflections of it are present in the Diwan-i-Khas of the Amer Palace. However, the fort was completed and fully expanded by Jai Singh I. He built a beautifully painted Ganesh poll in the palace that still captivates the eyes of may visitors.
                            <br />
                            Many ancient structures built by the Meenas have seen the wrath of time and lost their identity. But the edifice of the Amer fort still stands in all its glory. The fort saw many improvements in design and structure by the successive Rajputana rulers over 150 years. It is what shaped it into an excellent example of artistic architectural style.
