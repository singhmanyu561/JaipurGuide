                        <br></br>
                        <p>
                            Jaigarh Fort is a monumental fort located on the Aravalli Ranges of Rajasthan, towering at an impressive height of 500m above sea level. The fort was constructed in 1726 by the famous Raja Jai Singh II as a means to fortify the Amer Fort.
                            <br/><br/>
                            In fact, you can see an unobstructed view of Amer Fort and its complex from the Jaigarh Fort and also witness a breath-taking view of the green hills and lakes that surround the fort. It is one of the most distinctive historical monuments in the Jaipur area and has many unique features that make it unique.
                              <br /><br />
                            The largest canon in the world, which is called the Jaivana Cannon, can be found inside the premises. The canon was built inside the Jaigarh Fort itself and is said to have participated in many famous Rajput battles and wars. Other attractions inside the fort include the Vilas Mandir, the Aram Mandir, Laxmi Vilas and the Lalit Mandir.
                              <br /><br />
                            A unique feature of the fort is the lattice-work windows from where you can observe the expanse of the surrounding landscape and the large Persian garden which has four distinct parts. The original purpose of the Jaigarh Fort was to store arms, ammunition, armours and supplies for the Amer Fort in case of war.
                              <br /><br />
                            It is now a significant historical monument itself, with visitors travelling from far and wide to get an insight into the rich culture and history of the Rajputs of Amer. The monument is approximately 3 kilometres long and stands at a width of 1 kilometre.

                        <h2>History of Jaigarh Fort</h2>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>
                            The area that is home to the Jaigarh Fort and the Amer Fort was initially ruled by the Meenas, and it is believed that the Jaigarh Fort was built by them along with the Amer Fort. The Meenas originally built the fort as the home of the King and the royal family, who resided there, apart from their residency in the Amer Fort.
                              <br /><br />
                            After the Meenas were overthrown by the Kachwahas, they made certain changes in the structure of the fort. During the rule of the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, the fort came under the charge of Raja Jai Singh II who made significant changes to the structure and utility of the fort, and because of his contributions, the fort came to be named Jaigarh- after Jai Singh.
                              <br /><br />
                            Throughout the reign of the Mughals, including that of the great emperor Akbar, Jaigarh Fort was used as a place to keep the treasure, loot, arms, ammunition and other supplies for the Rajputs. An interesting feature about the fort is that despite seeing several rules and coming under siege many times, no one truly ever managed to capture the fort, which is why it earned the name- Victory Fort.
